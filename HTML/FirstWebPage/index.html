    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a technology enthusiast who believes that we are eliminating our biological limitations with technology and building a more just and free future. For many years, I tried to improve myself in the field of hardware and software and try to support the people around me as much as possible. As of 2020, with the rapidly changing living and working conditions due to the pandemic, I decided to switch my career in technology to the production part and focused on coding studies. After a year of basic education, I started to work in the field of blockchain development, which has attracted my attention for a long time. I am proud to be a part of this work in the development of this field, which I have adopted philosophically. I would like to add code development experience to the experience and knowledge I have gained in the field of operations for many years. In order to use my experience in these two fields together and to be more useful, I want to continue my career in devOps as the next step.</p>
